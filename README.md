#Grocery shop billing System

A traditional supermarket billing system with some added functionality. This system is built for fast data processing and bill generation for supermarket customers. The billing database is a vast collection of product name, price and other product specific data. A product when billed is searched from the database and its price is added to the bill based upon the product quantity. The system also contains discounts on various products so that the product is offered at discounted price while billing. The supermarket billing system is built to help supermarkets calculate and display bills and serve the customer in a faster and efficient manner.
